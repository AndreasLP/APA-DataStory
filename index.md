# Evolution of the political cleavage in the USA

Donald Trump's election in 2017 was only one illustration of the Left-Right political cleavage in the United States of America. Leveraging the [Quotebank dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4277311), we propose to measure the evolution of this cleavage across time, and especially focus on how major elections i.e. the presidential election or midterms affect the cleavage short-term. We're expecting this cleavage to increase, specially around events such as the presidential election or some specific events like the outbreak of the corona epidemic (2020), [major mass shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States&oldid=1054289389), the first impeachment of Trump (2019), the riot in Charlottesville (2017). We are not looking at events from 2021, and hence, the January 6th riots and Joe Biden taking office are omitted.
The political cleavage is measured through a sentiment analysis over the quotes from contemporary political members of the republican and democratic parties targeting members of the other party.

## Overall look
Sections 2 and 3.1 of sentiment_eda
How is the data distributed (per party directly or just all quotes altogether), seems to be random, average of 0 over time. Really the case? 
Also include examples of very negative and positive quotes 
Need to dive in the data to get meaningful insights.

Since we are analyzing the sentiment of each quote, we will first take a look at the semantic side of the analysis.

## Who is the most aggressive?

Olivier's part

In 2017 and 2018, aggressive speakers are overwhelmingly democrats. Only one republican is denoted as aggressive. In 2019, we have an exact parity between democrats and republicans. Indeed, Donald Trump is counted twice, once under "donald trump" and once under "president donald trump".

From the most aggressive table, we clearly see that something seems to have happened around 2016 (Trump's election?) which seems to have (1) greatly increased the number of quotes about the other camp by politicians and, (2) greatly increased the number of aggressive speakers (democrats in that case). In 2019, republicans seem to have responded to that aggressivity by also being aggressive. This leads us to think that major political events like Trump's election could have been a driver to increase the political cleavage in the USA.
